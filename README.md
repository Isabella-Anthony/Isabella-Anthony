## Welcome, my name is Isabella Anthony 💫

I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Florida International University. I have a strong interest in exploring the latest developments in technology. Therefore, I have been expanding my skills with topics such as cloud computing, distributed systems, Machine learning, and full-stack development.



## 🧠 What I’m interested In
- System-level evaluation of RAG pipelines
- Async architectures for latency bound workloads
- Reliability trade-offs in emerging compute stacks


## 👩🏻‍💻 Currently working on Capstone Project
My capstone project focuses on building a unified orchestration layer for hybrid systems that combine CPUs, GPUs, and Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The idea is to treat the QPU like a specialized accelerator inside a heterogeneous cluster, making it easier to move from experimental quantum scripts to production-ready distributed workflows.



## 📘 Currently Learning

Currently learning the fundamentals of operating systems, including:
- Processes & threads, Scheduling and synchronization, Deadlocks, Virtual memory, OS-level security and protection.
 
Currently studying database management systems, including:
- Relational and ER modeling, Schema design and normalization, SQL and relational algebra, database organization and system architecture



## 🎯 Research
